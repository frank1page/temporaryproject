            <h1>Why I'm Mad: It's Not You, It's Me</h1>
            <p>I don't like how <em>news</em> is disseminating on Facebook. It's a cesspool of otherwise irrelevant information. It's catered to your personal preferences and I think it's idiotic. Why should news be tailored made to my "preferences" by computer algorithms? Because Facebook holds this big "Fuck You, We Know Better!" sign. You've probably seen it. It's in between the masthead and the "Sorry About the Poking Feature" article.</p>
